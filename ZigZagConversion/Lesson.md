This algorithm takes in two parameters: a string s and an integer numRows. The output is the string in a zigzag pattern, where the number of rows is specified by numRows.

The algorithm first checks if numRows is 1, in which case the input string is returned as is. If numRows is greater than 1, the algorithm initializes an empty string result to store the output and a variable step which is calculated as 2 * numRows - 2. This step variable is used to control the index at which the next character should be picked from the input string.

The algorithm then uses two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through each row of the zigzag pattern, while the inner loop iterates through the characters of the input string. At each iteration, the character at the current index is added to the result string.

The inner loop also includes an additional check to add the characters that form the diagonal of the zigzag pattern. This check is performed only when the current row is not the first or last row, and the index of the diagonal character is within the range of the input string.

The function finally returns the result string, which contains the input string in the zigzag pattern.
